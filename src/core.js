// Fracture — core gameplay engine. Pure logic, no DOM/canvas dependency, so it
// can be unit-tested headlessly (see tests/core.test.mjs) and driven by any
// renderer. This module is the single source of truth for the fixed
// resolution order locked in design-doc-skeleton.md Section 3:
//
//   1. line clear resolves -> shards generated (Section 2, safety rule applied
//      at generation time)
//   2. shard queue insertion: room in queue -> queue; queue at cap -> force
//      insert into the active tray (overflow escalation)
//   3. tray refill (only once ALL tray slots are empty): queued shards drain
//      first, then fresh random pieces fill remaining slots
//   4. game-over check, run last, after whichever of 2/3 most recently
//      touched the tray
//
// Implementation decisions NOT dictated by the design doc (flagged here and
// in the build report, not silently buried):
//   - QUEUE_CAP = 4 (doc says "~3-4", picked the upper bound)
//   - No player-facing piece rotation (matches the doc's own cited genre
//     precedent: Block Blast / 1010! / Woodoku)
//   - Shard color = color of the piece the player just placed to trigger the
//     clear (well-defined even when one placement clears multiple lines at
//     once, unlike "color of the cells in the cleared line" which would be
//     ambiguous across cells placed at different times)
//   - Scoring model (points per cell, line-clear bonus, auto-convert value)
//     is an invented placeholder — Section 1 says only "clears -> scores",
//     Block Blast's actual scoring curve isn't specified in the doc.
//   - Overflow force-insert targets the tray slot just vacated by the piece
//     that triggered the clear first; if a second shard overflows in the same
//     turn, it takes the next empty tray slot; if none exists, it appends as
//     a temporary extra slot beyond the normal 3 (consumed/removed once
//     placed, tray returns to base size 3 on the next full refill). The doc
//     does not address simultaneous multi-shard overflow in one turn.
//
// Section 5b (first-session exposure scripting) implementation decisions,
// flagged the same way — see the "Section 5b" block below for the code:
//   - DEVIATION (game-designer re-verification, docs/playtest-findings.md
//     item 5): the design doc's own text says the scripted piece should be
//     "the round's 2nd or 3rd piece, not the 1st" (originally read as *dealt
//     tray-slot position*, slot index 1, not chronological play order — play
//     order is the player's choice; swapping a piece's shape after it's
//     already been looked at / mid-drag would be worse for legibility than
//     the alternative, so the shape is still committed once, at deal time,
//     unchanged). The STATED reason for "not 1st" was a redundant queue-
//     ceiling guard this implementation never actually relies on (it uses a
//     conservative "assume only 1 free tray slot" constant regardless of
//     real play order — see requiredQueueLenForOverflow). Re-verification
//     surfaced a real cost to keeping it at slot 1 that the doc's authors
//     couldn't have known about yet: a careless/naive-leaning play style
//     (picks tray slot 0 first, falls through only if unplaceable — see
//     tools/playtest-sim/sim10_onboarding_overflow_fix.mjs's "naive" bot,
//     modeled on the same profile playtest-findings.md item 1 identifies as
//     the actual at-risk audience) plays whatever sibling sits in slot 0
//     BEFORE the scripted piece nearly every round, which can silently
//     consume the exact board cells the scripted combo depends on (PM's
//     "secondary" finding, generalized — see docs/playtest-findings.md item
//     5). Moving the scripted piece to slot 0 removes the opportunity for
//     that failure mode entirely for exactly the play style most likely to
//     trigger it, at no measured cost to the combo-hoarder profile (whose
//     policy doesn't consider slot position at all) or to growth-safety
//     (unaffected by play order either way). A deliberate, data-backed
//     deviation from the doc's literal "not 1st" text — flagged here and in
//     the build report, not silently changed.
//   - The scripted combo is constructed by *scanning the real, player-built
//     board* for an already-existing >=3-line opportunity and dealing a
//     shape that completes it — never by fabricating/overwriting board cells
//     the player didn't place. tools/playtest-sim/sim8_onboarding_scripted.mjs
//     stamps the board directly, but that is a test-verification stand-in
//     ("the tutorial sets up this board"), not a live-gameplay technique —
//     overwriting a real player's placed cells in a shipped build would be a
//     visible, bug-shaped integrity problem. Consequence: the "guarantee"
//     is closer to "very likely, and retried every eligible round until it
//     happens" than a hard mathematical guarantee inside exactly clears 5-8.
//     Flagged in the build report as a resolved judgment call, not silently
//     decided.
//   - The other (non-scripted) slot(s) in an armed round are dealt shapes
//     verified incapable of clearing any line on the current board — this is
//     what makes the guard-rail check hold *by construction* in the common
//     case (queue level literally cannot move between arm-time and fire-time
//     from a sibling's clear if nothing else can generate a shard), rather
//     than by hoping the player plays the scripted slot first.
//   - The arm-time guard-rail check does NOT compare against the queue's raw
//     length at deal time. Only one of the round's TRAY_BASE_SIZE slots is
//     reserved for the scripted piece, so the *other* (TRAY_BASE_SIZE - 1)
//     slots still drain from the queue in that same refill, deterministically,
//     before the scripted piece is ever placed. The check therefore gates on
//     the length the queue will actually have *after* that same-refill drain
//     (see planOnboardingArm) — checking the raw pre-drain length would gate
//     on the wrong number and could arm rounds the fire-time check would
//     then have to reject.
//
// REVISION (game-designer, re-verification of a PM-found gap — see
// docs/playtest-findings.md item 4 and item 5 below): the ONE-SHOT version of
// drain-suppression + the ">= 3-line, single shared safe-level" version of
// arming above shipped with a real bug, not just a residual-risk footnote --
// re-verified with tools/playtest-sim/sim10_onboarding_overflow_fix.mjs
// against 300 games: overflow rate went from 0/300 to (see that file's
// latest run / docs/playtest-findings.md item 5 for the actual number).
// Root cause: forced-into-tray shard count is exactly
// max(0, shardCount - (QUEUE_CAP - queueLenAtFire)), and staying safe from
// tray growth (forced <= 1 free slot, conservatively assuming only 1 free
// slot — never relying on play order) requires forced === EXACTLY 1, which
// has exactly ONE solution for queueLenAtFire per shardCount, not a range:
//   queueLenAtFire === QUEUE_CAP - shardCount + 1
// A single shared "<= 2" gate (ONBOARDING_SAFE_QUEUE_LEVEL) is only that
// exact value for the 4-line/3-shard case; for the far more common 3-line/
// 2-shard case the correct value is 3, which the old "<=2" gate explicitly
// excluded — so 157/163 armed rounds in the PM's sim were structurally
// incapable of ever overflowing. Fixed by (1) computing the required exact
// queue level per combo size instead of reusing one shared ceiling, and
// (2) making drain-suppression repeat across multiple refills (bounded by
// ONBOARDING_MAX_SUPPRESSED_REFILLS) so the queue can actually climb toward
// that level via ordinary organic shard generation between refills, instead
// of a single suppression that can only *preserve* whatever level already
// happened to be there (usually ~0).

  // that as fine to LEAVE UNCAPPED for genuine organic play — real growth
  // there requires a compound precondition confirmed near-unreachable across
  // ~4,200 sim games (9/2000 even under an adversarial extreme-hoarder bot,
  // and never inflating tray size in practice). That verdict does NOT carry
  // over to a round where Section 5b's onboarding system elevated the queue
  // toward an armed combo's required level: that state deliberately (or, in
  // the second case below, incidentally) recreates the "queue held near cap"
  // precondition for the *whole round*, so a SECOND, unplanned clear later
  // in that same round can compound with the scripted piece's own overflow
  // and blow past the per-event-safe queue level this file otherwise
  // guarantees. Two independently-confirmed ways in:
  //   - `suppressedThisRound`: drain suppression itself held the queue near
  //     cap (confirmed reachable in re-verification, seeds 107 and 240 of
  //     tools/playtest-sim/sim10_onboarding_overflow_fix.mjs) -- a sibling
  //     piece that was verified safe against the board at deal time becomes
  //     newly clear-capable once an earlier placement in the same round
  //     changes the board.
  //   - `armedRound` without suppression: the queue can organically already
  //     sit AT QUEUE_CAP the instant an eligible refill fires (suppression
  //     never engages here -- see maybeRefillTray's `state.shardQueue.length
  //     < QUEUE_CAP` guard -- but the refill can still arm, because the
  //     deterministic same-refill drain of the OTHER slots can land exactly
  //     on a combo's required post-drain level). That refill deals REAL,
  //     un-vetted drained shards into the round's non-scripted slots (shard
  //     siblings are deliberately never reshaped -- see header comment,
  //     "Section 3 owns that semantics"). If one of those shard siblings gets
  //     played and clears a line before the scripted piece does, its own
  //     overflow can consume the only slot the scripted piece's overflow was
  //     counting on. Confirmed independently reachable by direct simulation
  //     (armed-while-unsuppressed: 46/20,000 games under an adversarial
  //     extreme-hoarder bot; actual compounding sibling clear + reproduced
  //     tray growth to length 5: a hand-constructed repro against this exact
  //     engine, not just traced) -- this is not a hypothetical, `armedRound`
  //     was a real, unguarded second path to the identical bug the
  //     `suppressedThisRound` check already exists to close.
  // Rather than trying to dynamically re-validate every remaining tray piece
  // against the board after every placement (which would mean silently
  // reshaping a piece the player is already looking at mid-round -- worse
  // for legibility than the alternative, same principle the header comment
  // already applies to scripted-piece construction), fail closed both ways:
  // mirror the Section 2 ship-blocking safety rule and auto-convert this
  // shard straight to score instead of growing the tray. Scoped tightly to
  // an active onboarding round (`suppressedThisRound` OR `armedRound`) so it
  // never fires for ordinary organic play outside one -- the locked "leave
